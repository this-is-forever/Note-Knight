# Note-Knight
Notepad with file encryption! (and some other small tweaks)

Build the file using Maven! It will automatically download the SCrypt library from its source.

Just want to try out the application? You can download it from [here](https://github.com/this-is-forever/Note-Knight/raw/master/Note-Knight.zip).

Ensure you have at least Java 11 installed and run launcher.bat. You can configure Windows to open .nkx files with launcher.bat, that way you can open right into Note Knight from Windows Explorer!
